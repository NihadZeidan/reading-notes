# OAuth 

### OAuth: is simply delegation of authority, you can access an application services without giving your password ( via other applications credentials,  log-in via google for example). Like giving the valuet key to your car !


### OAuth Process :
1. The user must permit this process.
2. The application go and ask for one-time-use Code
2. Redirect the user to service provider. To approve .
3. The User Gives Permission to the second app. To generate Token form that code.
4. The Consumer Obtains an Access Token.
5. The Consumer Accesses the Protected Resource.

### Pros Of OAuth:

1. Allows to read data from another app.
2. It's available for Web, desktop and mobile Apps.
3. It uses Authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.


### Cons of OAuth: 

The downside to all of this is that it takes a good deal of work to set up these tokens. OAuth's lack of simplicity is one of the main differences between OAuth security and API key security.
