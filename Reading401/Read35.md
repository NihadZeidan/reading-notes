# Ethics in Tech

I read the first article about ethics in workplace and I was shocked about the results, part of any business is to generate money to sustain their growing business, and unfortunately some companies will do anything to generate more profit and increase sales. It could push it's employees to do wrong things sometimes, and what I learned from the story shared, is that we as a developers (or any worker) need to think twice about the task that was given to them and if their is something wrong, we should stand and raise this issue, I saw many head lines saying about how the employees can affect the companies decision even if they are not involved in the decision making process, and how they can make the company to draw from any wrong behavior if we stand together against the wrong thing.

Who dies when the car is forced into a no-win situation (Trolly Problem)?
Ethical problems will not be eliminated, and we all face these kind of problems where there is no right or wrong answer, and I believe so as any automatic machine, no matter how smart our programs are, how fast they learn, they will still some vague points that can not be predicted. However, I think automation of things will reduce human errors and will result in better outcomes overtime, as machines will be able to learn to choose the best situation and as tech become more advanced.

Quote
“Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another.”

—Immanuel Kant, “What is Enlightenment?” (1784)
