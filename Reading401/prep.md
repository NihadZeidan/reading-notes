## Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.




##### How you value your time is how you value your life. The goal is to make progress toward things you see as important (your goals) not to be busy.

How to appreciate and value your time: 
- Take a look on your all previous activities
- value them honestly, do they worth 1000$/h ?


### Quotes I Liked: 

“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss
“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.” -Jeff Goins

“Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.” - Book Deep Work

As You Think, So You Are
“As a man thinketh, so is he. As he continues to think, so he remains.” -James Allen


“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” -Steve Jobs 

“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving  

![Meta Skills](/Images/METASKILLS.jpeg)




The most valuable skill is problem solving, as I started programing I had a lot of notes about how important it is to break down the big idea (or big problem) into individual steps and those steps have more detailed steps inside them. I noticed that it's too important to learn how to solve a problem utilizing the skills you have (programming skills). 

### Steps to solve problems :
1. Understand the problem, knowing the problem is half the answer. and to do it you can (write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck)).

2. PLAN, do not start immediately write down or visualize the steps before starting. 

3. DIVIDE, as I said before and as my note book full of this kind of notes TO DIVIDE or BREAK DOWN THE PROBLEM. 

   - Break the problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

   - Solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

   - Simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

   - Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

   - Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!


4. If still STUCK do the following (Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!): 
  - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

  - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and   begin again with fresh eyes.

  - Research: Ahh, use your GoogleFu skills. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. 


5. Practice “micro problem-solving”. you can do that by playing problem solving video-games or practice code challenges (use this website `https://coderbyte.com/`)

Each time, a little more of the competition falls away. Until all that is left is you: the best version of you.” — Ryan Holiday

## THE 5 WHYS (5Y)


It was introduced by Sakichi Toyoda, the Japanese industrialist, inventor, and founder of Toyota Industries. it follows the "go and see" philosophy (when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the process or problem in question). You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.

##### How to Use the 5 Whys:

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"  (here we are looking for things that actually happened not guesses (Search for answers that are grounded in fact))
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop 
      (You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.)
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
