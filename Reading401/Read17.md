# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Describe “The Cloud”
Is using another server/computer that is settled remotely as it's your own. 

## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
container is the entire runtime environment, it consists of an app, packages, dependencies, libraries and config files. containers make the app runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## What is auto-scaling?
Is the process of modifying the resources that is needed to the app automatically.

## What is bandwidth?
Is the maximum data to transfer across a given path. (network bandwidth, data bandwidth).

## How do cloud providers compute service costs?
The cost is calculated based on the resources the company or individual may use in the VM in order to run their apps/services smoothly.
These recourses may be storage, processor, bandwidth and RAM.


------------------------------------------

## Server Instances: 
An instance is a single copy of the software running on a single physical or virtual server. If you run two copies of the software on the same physical or virtual server, that counts as two instances.


## Containers:
Is a complete unit of the code (the entire runtime environment). it makes the apps run more faster and reliable from one cloud to another.

## Cloud Services:
Is a service that will allow the users to use different remote computers/VM as they own it, the benefits of Cloud services:
 - Reduce costs of hardware/software.
 - Load Balance.
 - Mobility.
 - Data access/ Backup.
 - maintenance.
 - More security and speed.
 - Collaboration.

Types of Cloud Services:
SaaS --> Software as a service. (google drive, gmail)
Paas --> platform as a service. (GitHub, Heroku, AWS Elastic beanstalk, Netlify)
Iaas --> Infrastructure as a service. (AWS EC2, Azure)

 
## Cloud Architecture
it refer to the set of softwares, applications, databases, recourses that the cloud can have to leverage its capabilities. It isn't only define the component but the relationship between them.


## AWS:
Amazon Web Services, a (huge) collection of services that Amazon provide as a cloud computing, some of the AWS services are AWS EC2, Elastic Beanstalk and IAM ...

## EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:
Elastic Compute cloud is a IaaS service that allow the user to control the app, data, runtime, middleware and OS
BeanStalk is a PaaS that allow the user to control only the application and the data.
Heroku is also a Paas. 


---------------------------------------------


Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
EC2, Beanstalk and Cloud services

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
Cloud architecture, more AWS services and Server instance.

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
AWS S3, Lambda and Lambda functions.


----------------------------------------------

## AWS S3: 
Amazon Simple Storage Service, is SaaS that offer object storage service, the Benefits of AWS S3:

 - cost-effective.
 - Security.
 - Easy manage data and access control.
 - Query in place (you can use SQL to analyze and interact with data).
 - Industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and durability.

## AWS Lambda:

### Notes 


Runtime is:
The length of time a program takes to run.

Serverless computing:
is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers.
