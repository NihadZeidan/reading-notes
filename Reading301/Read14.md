# DATABASE NORMALIZATION 

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. 



There are three main reasons to normalize a database. 

1. The first is to minimize duplicate data. 
2. the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues. 
3. and the third is to simplify queries.





#### Definition of Normalization

- First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.
- Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
- Third Normal Form – The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
