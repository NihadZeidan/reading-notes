# Diversity & Inclusion 

Marketing played a vital role in delivering the idea that computers were for men and boys back in the 70's and 80's.

Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. According to Scott E.

Companies are losing out on great talent.
Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base .
