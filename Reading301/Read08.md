## SQL 

![](../Images/image2-1.png)


- SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data.



- A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.



- A query in itself in SQL is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for,

- You can think of a table in SQL as a type of an entity (ie. Dogs), and each row in that table as a specific (instance) of that type (ie. A pug, a beagle, a different colored pug, etc). This means that the columns would then represent the common (properties) shared by all instances of that entity (ie. Color of fur, length of tail, etc).


-----------------------------------

some SQL querys to use

SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name
WHERE (conidtions for each row)
ORDER BY column_name ASC/DESC (to order each column)
LIMIT num (to limit the number of rows to show)
SETOFF num (to define where to begin in rows);
