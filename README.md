### Growth Mindset I see it as the ability to obsereb and learn something new, baring in mind that effort and hard wroking is what you need to reach your goal. 


I would say in order to remind myself to stay in the growth mindset mode the following:
1. **Listen** to others and take advices from people who you really trust.
2. **BE Flixable**(Agile). as I see intelligance is the ability to adapt.
3. Reflect your day and try to take the best of it and learn from your mistakes.
4. know that each one of us has his own point of view, and this what make us different.
5. Always remember that nothing worth having comes easy.
