Concepts I have read about:

#### Text editors: software to edit and manage texts especially that's related to windows building texts.

features in text editors: Code Completion ( to provide suggestions to the typing codes)/ syntax highlight ( to read codes easer)/ Themes ( to reduce eyes strain)/ extentions (to add functionality to your text editor) 

 --------------------------------

#### Linux: is a graphical system interface

#### Command line: is a text-based interface for a system. (Terminal)
----------------------------------------

Commands: 

- echo: to display messages

- pwd: path to working directory

- ls : list (without the hidden files)

- ls -la : list all (even the hidden)

- /etc: list the directories content. 

- cd : to change directory.

----------------------------

#### Path: is the means to reach to the file or folder in a system.

two types: absolute path, file or directory location in relation to its root (/) 

relative path: file or directory location to where we are.
