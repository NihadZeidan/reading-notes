## Javascript Debugging

Stack: is when a function needed other function to run, JS interpreter make the needed function on top in order to run the new one .


The JavaScript console: will tell you when there is a problem with a script,
where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.


You Can use Throw Error code to generate errors you know 
usinhg : `throw new Error('Message');`


You can use Try, Catch, Finally code to fix an error

Try: to try to execute the code.
catch: if there is an exception run this code.
finally: this always gits executed.

`try {} catch(exception){} finally{}` 




**Tips to do when debugging JS code :**

1. Use another browser
2. Add numbers in console log and move it line by line to see where is the error.
3. Comment the code line by line.
4. Explain the code to some one else (in explaining process you will figure out the problem)
5. Search online (Stackoverflow, W3schools)
6. Use Code Playgrounds (Jsbin.com, Jsfiddle.com, Dabblet.com), where you can ask in a fourm.
7. Use Validation Tools (Jslint.com, Jshint.com )
