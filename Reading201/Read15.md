## Group Norms, How good teams built !


The first finding of Google research about teams was the 'Who' part in any team does not really matter. So each person background or intrestes does not matter much to build effective team.

The second finding was the informal relations did not really affect any team performance. 

The third finding was the Group Norms. "Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather" and they found that understanding and influancing the group norms are the keys to improve any team. 


There were two important things that must be in any group norm in order to improve the work which are:
1-  ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’
2- ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. "psycological safety"


Also they found that other factors my affect the success of any team like clear goals and dependability. But the most important factor is "psycological safety".

In order to achieve a "psycological safety" we need to make every one speak as equal to each other and empathy to each other. this is how we create a bond in a team.  "In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs"


So every company should incourage their teams and employees to not put a face for work, instead being sensetive to each other and listen to each other is the key.
