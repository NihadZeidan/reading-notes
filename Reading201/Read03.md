## Lists 

##### 3 types of lists in HTML:
< ol > (orderd list)
< ul > (unorderd list)
< dl > (definition list)
   - < dl > contain of: < dt > (definition term) and < dd > (definition)

--------------------------------------

## Boxes

CSS treat every element in HTML as it's inside a box and apply different changing to the boxes. For example:
 - width and height
 - min-width/ height property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow.
 - max-width/ height property indicates the maximum siz a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
- Overflow property to tell the browser what to do if the contant is bigger than the box. It can have one of two values:
hidden or scroll .

Every box has border, padding and margin:
 - Borders are the outside lines.
 - Padding is the space between borders and contant.
 - Margin is the space between the box and the other one.

 Borders has three values: border-width, border-style, border-color, and you can put them together in the same order.
 exp : { border: 3px dotted #0088dd; }


 display property: inline, block, inline-block,non 

 visibility property: to hide or show the boxes (hidden or visible)

 box-shadow property: to add shadow around box.

 border-radius property: to make borders rounded. 100px = circle

## Javascrip 

This is how to create array in JS:

  - var create = [ 'blue ', ' white', 'black ']; 

falsy values in js: treated as false (or number zero 0) 
truthy values in js: treated as true (or number one 10)

If the condition never returns false in LOOPS, you get what is commonly referred to as an infinite loop.
