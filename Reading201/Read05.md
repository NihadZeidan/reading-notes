## HTML IMAGES

It is adviced to use a specifice directory for all images you use in your site.

< img src="image source here" alt="to add discription to your image" title="to add more info for the image (it will appear when the user hover over the image) >

**You can use the width and height attributes for images too** 

**You can use align attribute in images to align it left, right, top, bottom or middle, and let the text float on the other side, but its NOT available in HTML 5**

**IN CSS you can use float property instead of align** 

**Always use the right resolution of an image which is 72ppi(most of the computers webpages show images on 72ppi)**

in vector type images you can change the dimentions without efficting it. 

##### < figure > ==> is used by HTML5 to add figure and caption to it by using < figcaption > inside it.
