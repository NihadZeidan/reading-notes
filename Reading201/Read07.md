## Domain Modeling

Domain Modeling: is the process of creating  in code to solve a problem.

Object-orianted Model: is a model  that has methods and properties to solve a problem.

` Math.random() ` = to return random number 
` Math.round() ` = to round to the closest integer number
` Math.floor() ` = to turn the number in integers.

**new** keyword to create new constructor object. 
`.generateRandom` = to geenerate randon number.

Tips to follow when building your own domain models:

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## HTML Tables 

` <table> ` = used to create tabel in HTML 
` <tr> ` = to start new row in a table (table row)
`<td> ` = to insert data in table (table data)
`<th>` = to add heading to the tabel (table heading)
` colspan= "number" `= to shift in line in the table (colon span)
`rowspan="number"` = to shift rows in table.

For long tables = `<thead>` `<tbody>` `<tfooter>`
